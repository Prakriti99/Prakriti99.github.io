                    <section class="page__content" itemprop="text" style="font-size: 17.5px; margin-top: 1%;">

                        <p><em>"By far, the greatest danger of Artificial Intelligence is that people conclude too early that they understand it.” — <b>Eliezer Yudkowsky</b></em></p>
                        
                        <p> I am currently pursuing a <a href="https://graduate.northeastern.edu/program/master-of-science-in-robotics-17772/">Master's in Artificial Intelligence</a> at Northeastern University, where I have also served as a Teaching Assistant for the "Foundations of AI" course, guiding students through the core concepts of machine learning and AI. </p>
                        <p>I hold a Bachelor's in Computer Science with a specialization in AI from NIIT University, India, which laid a strong foundation for my journey in the world of artificial intelligence.</p>
                        <p>Born and raised in East Africa and growing up in India, I have been fortunate to experience a multitude of cultures, shaping my ability to adapt and collaborate effectively in diverse environments. </p>
                        <p> With 3 years of experience as a Data Scientist/Machine Learning Engineer, I have worked across various industries, Tech at IBM, Healthcare at Mayo Clinic, Sustainable Energy at Danfoss. My work has involved building computer vision pipelines for image classification/segmentation, developing natural language processing (NLP) systems for sentiment analysis and text summarization, creating sales forecasting models using time series analysis, and fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) to build domain specific chatbots.
                        </p>
                        <!--<p>During my time at Danfoss, I completed an 8-month Data Science co-op, where I worked on innovative projects that leveraged machine learning and AI to optimize energy consumption and enhance predictive maintenance solutions. I have also been involved in projects that utilize NLP for conversational AI and build a sales forecasting pipeline, which helped improve employee-customer service efficiency and engagement. My diverse experience across these domains has strengthened my ability to design, develop, and deploy machine learning models that solve real-world problems.</p>
                        <p>-->
                        I am always keen to learn new skills, explore new domains, and take on new challenges. I believe that growth comes from stepping out of one’s comfort zone and continuously innovating. If you share my passion for innovation and technological advancement, I invite you to join me on this journey of exploration and discovery.
                        </p>
                        <p>On off days, you'll find me on the Tennis Court, or building a game using Unity in C# :D</p>
